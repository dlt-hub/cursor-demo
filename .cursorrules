<examples>
<example>
Input: I need to pull data from GitHub's events API for the dlt repo (https://api.github.com/repos/dlt-hub/dlt/events) into DuckDB. I want different event types in separate tables so I can analyze PRs, issues, and commits separately. The events have an `id` field we should use to avoid duplicates. Need to handle pagination. I need write disposistion

<pipeline_analysis>
The user gave clear instructions and I don't require further information.

1. Source Evaluation:
   - GitHub Events API as source
   - REST API with pagination support
   - Optional authentication for higher rate limits
   - Events need to be split by type

2. Data Organization:
   - Dynamic table creation based on event type
   - Incremental loading by created_at timestamp
   - Unique event ID as primary key
   - Append disposition for continuous updates

3. Implementation Requirements:
   - Need dlt's request helper for API calls
   - Handle pagination properly
   - Consider rate limits
   - Add proper error handling
</pipeline_analysis>

1. Install dlt and destination/source extras:
```bash
pip install dlt[duckdb] streamlit
```

2. Initialize a new dlt project with connectors we need:
We are reading from an official source listed in <available_sources_for_dlt_init>:
```bash
dlt init github_api duckdb
```

3. Add your GitHub token to `.dlt/secrets.toml`:
```toml
api_secret_key = "api_secret_key" # please set me up!
```

4. Replace `github_api_pipeline.py` with the following code:
```python
import dlt
from dlt.sources.helpers import requests

@dlt.resource(
    primary_key="id",
    table_name=lambda i: i["type"],
    write_disposition="append",
)
def repo_events(last_created_at=dlt.sources.incremental("created_at")):
    url = "https://api.github.com/repos/dlt-hub/dlt/events?per_page=100"
    
    # Add authentication if token exists
    headers = {}
    if dlt.secrets.get('source.github.access_token'):
        headers['Authorization'] = f"token {dlt.secrets.get('source.github.access_token')}"

    while True:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        yield response.json()
        
        # Stop requesting pages if the last element was already older than
        # the initial value.
        if last_created_at.start_out_of_range:
            break
            
        # Get the next page.
        if "next" not in response.links:
            break
        url = response.links["next"]["url"]

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="github_events",
    destination="duckdb",
    dataset_name="github_events_data",
)

try:
    load_info = pipeline.run(repo_events)
    print("‚úîÔ∏è Pipeline completed successfully!")
    print(f"\n‚öôÔ∏è Processed rows: {pipeline.last_trace.last_normalize_info.row_counts}")
    print(load_info)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Pipeline failed! Reason: {str(e)}")
    raise
finally:
    print("\nüìä To explore your data:")
    print(f"dlt pipeline {pipeline.pipeline_name} show")
```

5. Run the pipeline:
```bash
python github_api_pipeline.py
```

6. Explore the loaded data:
```bash
dlt pipeline github_events show
```

Your data will be organized into separate tables in your DuckDB database, with each event type (IssuesEvent, PullRequestEvent, PushEvent, etc.) in its own table for easy analysis.
</example>
</examples>

Remember:
- Always provide complete setup instructions from virtual environment creation
- Show full working code with error handling
- Include data exploration commands
- Explain key concepts as they appear in the implementation

When analyzing requests, consider:
1. Source characteristics and requirements
2. Data organization needs
3. Incremental loading requirements
4. Error handling approach
5. Verification steps
```bash
dlt pipeline github_events show
```

Your data will be organized into separate tables in your DuckDB database, with each event type (IssuesEvent, PullRequestEvent, PushEvent, etc.) in its own table for easy analysis.
